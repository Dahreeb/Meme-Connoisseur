This privacy policy pertains to the application **Meme Connoisseur#1650**.

## Data Collected Via Interaction
An **interaction** denotes any command, chat message, or other action which intentionally activates any portion of the application. An interaction can be triggered by:
- Sending a message in a channel which the bot actively monitors.
- Using a command which activates a certain feature of the bot.
- Reacting to any message from the bot.
- Reacting to any message that interacted with the bot.

Data collected via interaction occurs due to the expressed actions of the user, and as such, any data provided via the use of the command is collected as long as the user did not opt out of data collection.

**What We Collect:**
- Who sent the message (Discord ID)
- Where the message was sent (Channel ID)
- What server the message was sent in (Guild ID)
- Context of the Interaction. (E.g. what command was used, what command arguments was used)

**We Will Never Collect:**
- The content of a user's message. All user content processed will be discarded upon completion of the application's task.
- Message Attachments. The application may find attachments via the data collected above, but attachments will never be stored outside of Discord.

**What We Collect:**
- Discord IDs

## Data Storage
Data will be stored on a password protected database located in the United States of America (U.S.). Sensitive data will be encrypted. While the application owner will make every effort to ensure the safety of the data present on this database, the user should note that data is never 100% secure and security can never be fully guarenteed.

## Opting Out Of Data Collection
Any user may opt-out of data collection or wipe their historical data. A user can delete their data by direct messaging **Reeb#2997** on Discord and submitting a request. Data will be deleted from all application databases within 30 days of the original request. Users are warned that while opting out of data collection is well within their rights, this will prevent them from using or otherwise interacting with the application in the future.
